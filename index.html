              The World Health Organization (WHO) also reported over 2,000 cases of suicide from 2000 to 2012, most

            The ratio presented is lower than other countries with similar income levels such as Malaysia (1.27 per 100,000) and Indonesia (0.3 per 100,000).
            Furthermore, access to mental health services is not equally distributed across the country, as most psychiatrists work in for-profit or private sectors in larger urban cities such as Metro Manila.

        <p> This was the <i>first mental health act legislation</i> in the Philippines. It outlines a framework for the integration and implementation of optimal mental health care, and

    <h3>So what's the problem?</h3>
    <p> The problem starts at home. Living within a culture that emphasizes resilience and humor amidst pain and personal suffering makes it all the more difficult to talk about mental illness out in the open. The stigma surrounding mental illness only adds to the layers of struggle of people who suffer from various mental health conditions. </p>
